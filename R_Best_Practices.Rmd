# R Best Practices {.tabset .tabset-pills}

Today we will be de-bunking coding myths and misconceptions.

You may have previously thought one of the following: 

"Why am I doing this??"

"I keep getting errors and I don't know why!!"

"How did they know the answer to that?" 

"Where do I even begin?!?"

If you've said these to yourself or have felt similar  emotions of frustration towards coding, this training is for YOU!! 

In today's session we will cover the purpose and benefits of R, debunk common coding myths, and equip you with a tool belt of resources for success!

Towards the end, we will dive deeper into ways to optimize your code via functional programming and iterations. 

Agenda: 
1. Why R? 
2. Debunking Common Coding Myths 
3. Best Practices Principles 
4. Problem Solving Workflow 
5. Functional Programming 
6. Iterations Expansion

## 1. Why R? 

"Why am I doing this??"

- quick review from the 1st session 

## 2. Debunking Common Coding Myths

"I keep getting errors and I don't know why!!"

- I got a warning in bright red text, my code must be ruined

- coders like Sam and Laura know the answers off the top of their head 


## 3. Best Practices Principles 

But I still feel like I don't know anything!!! My computer is going to explode!!

Let's go over coding best practices and build your tool belt for success! 

"How did they know the answer to that?" 

- utilize your resources
    - stack overflow 
    - help files 
    - pair programming 
- documentation and version control (Even if you're working by yourself)
    - Comments 
    - GitHub Repository!!! (stage commit push pull!)
- Reducing...
    - Repetitive code (pipeline, functional programming)
    - Bad variable names 
    - Complicating code 
- Take breaks and have fun !!!


Amazing work! We've built our toolbelt of success and are ready to start coding!

## 4. Problem Solving Workflow 

"Where do I even begin?!?"

- Building a road map to success 



Now you have both the tools and the roadmap to success!! 

## 5. Functional Programming
