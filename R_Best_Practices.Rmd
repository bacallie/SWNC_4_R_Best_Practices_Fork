# R Best Practices {.tabset .tabset-pills}

Today we will be de-bunking coding myths and misconceptions. 

![](images/Mythbusters.jpg)

You may have previously thought one of the following: 

"Why am I doing this??"

"I keep getting errors and I don't know why!!"

"How did they know the answer to that?" 

"Where do I even begin?!?"

If you've said these to yourself or have felt similar  emotions of frustration towards coding, this training is for YOU!! 

In today's session we will cover the purpose and benefits of R, debunk common coding myths, and equip you with a tool belt of resources for success!

Towards the end, we will dive deeper into ways to optimize your code via functional programming and iterations. 

Agenda: 
1. Why R? 
2. Debunking Common Coding Myths 
3. Best Practices Principles 
4. Problem Solving Workflow 
5. Functional Programming 
6. Iterations Expansion

## 1. Why R? 

"Why am I doing this??"

  - As introduced in previous sessions, R is one of the leading programming languages for statistics and data visualization, especially in the ecological community.

As you can see, R's strength comes from all of these elements working together. 

The beauty of the being open source and part of a collaborative community, is that you don't need to know how to do everything in order to succeed. People are constantly writing new code and sharing how they solved their problems via forums, reports, and packages. 

To review, packages are like the "expansion pack" or "power ups" in R code that allow you to perform tasks that don't come in the base language. For a deeper dive revisit Laura's [What is an R Package Guide](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/nps-SWNC/Shared%20Documents/SWNC%20All%20Staff/SWNC%20R%20Trainings/3%20-%20What%20is%20a%20package.docx?d=we63a96814b614a668fe5da83df8c82ba&csf=1&web=1&e=8gc1mc).

Packages are constantly being built, updated, and can be adapted based on user needs which meas R is always getting better as time goes forward. There is also a vast world of documentation that if you know how to look for it, allows you to learn as you code. 

In today's session we hope to be able to give you the tools to learn from and engage with the coding community in a sustainable manner. We know that like any language, R has a steep learning curve to it, so we want to break down as many barriers as we can for you to succeed. 


## 2. Debunking Common Coding Myths 

![](images/MythbustersLogo.jpg)

Let's start off by breaking down common misconceptions that throw people off when they begin to learn how to code. 

Myth #1: "I keep getting errors and I don't know why!!"

R likes to use bright red text for errors and warnings. However they shouldn't all have the same overwhelming sense of doom as implied by the color. It's important to learn how to distinguish a warning from an error, as well as learning how to decoding its message.


This handy graphic from [R @R(D)SVS](https://jillymackay.github.io/RatRDSVS/trouble.html) helps us do both! 
![](images/ErrorsVsWarnings.png)

The nice thing about R is that it often gives you a reason for why things have happened, which makes it a lot easier to troubleshoot your code. It also means that messages might pop up out of the blue and throw you off. Take the following example: 

![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/naDtw.png)

As you can see there's scary red text, however if you take a closer look you can see that its just giving you more info on the package being installed, and isn't actually a warning or error! 


Myth #2: "I've done the exact same thing you did and it isn't working!! R must hate me"

There will be times where you feel like you've typed the exact same thing over and over again and it isn't working, even thought it looks "exactly the same". Often the issue will be as small as a syntax error. 

R is very particular in its formatting, so something as small as a . or a } can trip up the code. This is why its important to double check your code, or compare with a friend who may be able to spot something that you missed after staring at the screen for so long. 

Take a look at the code below and try to figure out the issue in each example:

```{example}

#example 1 
letters<- c("R", "C," "B")

#example 2
x <- 7 
if(x > 10) {
  print("x > 10")
 else {
  print("x <= 10")
 }

#example 3
  data <- data.frame(
  x = rnorm(10),
  y = rnorm(10)
)
summary(dta[, 2])

```


This [blog post](https://statsandr.com/blog/top-10-errors-in-r/#using-a-function-that-is-not-installed-or-loaded) has more great examples of many common errors and how to fix them



Myth #3: "Coders like Sam and Laura know the answers off the top of their head!! I'll never get there" 

Although it may seem like we have all the answers, Laura and I area constantly learning, and often are furiously googling error messages and keywords to get an answer to our problem 

![](images/Typing.jpg)
Sure, after a while you start to remember how to solve common errors like typos and open brackets, but for the most part a skilled coder is just a skilled researcher and very VERY patient. 

## 3. Best Practices Principles 

But I still feel like I don't know anything!!! My computer is going to explode!!

Just Remember...

Let's go over coding best practices and build your tool belt for success! 

"How did they know the answer to that?" 

- utilize your resources
    - stack overflow 
    - help files 
    - pair programming 
- documentation and version control (Even if you're working by yourself)
    - Comments 
    - GitHub Repository!!! (stage commit push pull!)
- Reducing...
    - Repetitive code (pipeline, functional programming)
    - Bad variable names 
    - Complicating code 
- Take breaks and have fun !!!


Amazing work! We've built our toolbelt of success and are ready to start coding!

## 4. Problem Solving Workflow 

"Where do I even begin?!?"

![](images/Lost.jpg)

- Building a road map to success 


Now you have both the tools and the roadmap to success!! 

## 5. Functional Programming 
  - building functions 
  - function benefits 
## 6. Iterations Expansion 
  - lapply
